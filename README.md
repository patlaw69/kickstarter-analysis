# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickerstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is to assist a playwright who wants to start a campaign for her play Fever.  She has a limited budget and need to find the best way to do this.
### Purpose
Creating analysis to assist with the decision to start a crowdfunding campaign.  We will see if there are certain factors in common with a successful campaign.  we will do this through various comparisons on past campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data set that was used for this analysis was for the US market and compared various campaigned that were started and what their out was in that process.  We reviewed the time of year for the campaign and the amount that was to be raised for those campaigns and their outcome.  The challenges were not many but when attempting to find a way to measure the data, there were some delays.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
The most successful time to run a campaing would be in the summer months of June through August.  Over the years that were analyzed, there were more successful theater campaings than failed ones.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The campaign is expected to be successful if the amount is under 25000

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The data set could have been broken down even further in location and backers, not only country but could have provided address locations of the campaigns,andmore demographic information of the backers

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could have also used a sum of backers by category or possibly a sum of goal and pledged by country
